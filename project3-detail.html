            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>
              Music has always been a part of my life and daily routine. I
              noticed I've gotten pretty frustrated with how most music
              streaming apps work. You have to jump between a bunch of different
              apps just to listen, share with friends, or view your own stats. I
              thought there had to be a better way.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              My goal for this project was to design a mobile app that was about
              more than just playing music. I wanted to create an experience
              that would foster connection and community through music, whilst
              addressing the pain points of current music apps.

            <h1>Research</h1>
            <p>
              I created a survey to learn about other users' behaviors,
              frustrations, needs, and wants. I received 27 responses and did
              two follow-up interviews to gain deeper insights.
            </p>
            <br />

              <img src="assets/imgs/project3/survey.webp" />
            </div>
            <h2>Key Insights</h2>
            <p>
              A few things became clear: users felt their apps lacked social
              features, easy organization, and customization. This research
              guided my entire process. It was super encouraging to see that my
              initial vision for a social music app aligned so well with what
              other people wanted. It helped me feel confident in my design
              decisions.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>User Persona & Empathy Map</h2>
            <p>
              To further synthesize my research and empathize with users, I
              created a user persona and empathy map. I came up with the quote
              "Music is better when shared! I wish everything was in one cozy
              place." This statement encapsulates user's feelings and it became
              the core insight for the project.

            </div>
            <h2>User Journey Map</h2>
            <p>
              I mapped out a user journey to understand the user's flow,
              thoughts, feelings, and opportunities within the current music
              streaming landscape. This helped me pinpoint exactly where my app,
              "Jam," could solve their problems by offering a more social
              experience from awareness to loyalty.

            <h1>Design</h1>
            <p>
              With the research and user empathy complete, I began sketching
              wireframes on paper and created the final 10 key screens. The goal
              was to capture the app’s core features and user experience. I then
              digitized the wireframes in Figma, using a consistent auto-layout
              grid to make sure everything was aligned and scalable.
            </p>
            <br />
            <div class="project-img autowidth">
              <h1>Wireframes</h1>
              <img src="assets/imgs/project3/wireframes.webp" />
            </div>
            <p>
              When I moved on to prototyping, I wanted the app to feel fun and
              social, so I chose a hot-pink and red gradient as a key visual
              element, and I made all the design elements have rounded corners
              to make the app feel more approachable. I used Figma's interactive
              features to create button states and simple animations, like the
              record spinning when a song is playing.

            <h1>Reflection</h1>
            <p>
              This project was a great lesson in how much research and real
              insights can shape a product's direction. My initial idea was
              validated by users, and their feedback helped me prioritize
              features like a social feed and playlist sharing.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Looking back, I learned that a good design isn't just about making
              something look nice; it’s about solving real problems for real
              people. Taking the time to gather real feedback, create user
              personas, and map out their experiences helped me design something
              that was grounded in how users actually think and behave. My next
              step is to conduct more usability testing and get further feedback
              to refine the prototype and make it even better.
