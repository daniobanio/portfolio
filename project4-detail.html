            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>
              As part of a team project for our Project Management course, I
              contributed to the development of PlayPal, a fictional social
              platform where gamers rate and review their favorite titles. My
              individual role was to design and build an HTML email newsletter.
              The goal was to create a clean, engaging, and on-brand newsletter
              that catered to gamers, something our team would actually engage
              with ourselves. This project followed the Waterfall methodology
              and emphasized structured planning, design, and execution.

            <h1>Research</h1>
            <p>
              Before jumping into it, I spent time researching the best
              practices of HTML email design and development. I focused on key
              requirements like capping the layout at 750px max-width, designing
              for simplicity, building entirely with tables and using a
              box-model structure for spacing. Once I understood the
              constraints, I aligned with my team on the purpose of the
              newsletter: a weekly game recommendation digest for PlayPal users.

          <div class="project-para">
            <h1>Design</h1>
            <p>
              Using Figma, I designed a layout that was centered, and easy to
              scan. I focused on simplicity to make it easier on myself to
              translate to HTML later, using auto-layout to ensure consistent
              spacing and responsiveness. I applied the style guide provided by
              our designer, incorporating the logo, colors, and gradient accents
              to reflect PlayPal’s visual identity.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The layout consisted of a header, featured game section, secondary
              recommendations, and a call-toaction button — all spaced and
              styled in a way that felt intuitive for desktop viewing, with
              mobile behavior in mind. I kept everything structured for
              scalability and consistency.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Once I reviewed the prototype with my group, we locked the scope
              to just the recommendation newsletter

              <h1>Screens</h1>

            <h1>Development</h1>
            <p>
              This was my first time building anything with entirely tables. I
              am used to using Flexbox and Grid, so adapting to nested tables
              was a challenge at first. I quickly realized that planning the
              layout in advance — and thinking in table “boxes” helped me avoid
              confusion and gaining a headache from all these table tags.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Every style had to be written inline, which was time-consuming but
              necessary for compatibility across email clients. Once I finished
              coding the base, I ran my HTML through ChatGPT to double-check my
              CSS and make sure it worked across all major email clients. It
              suggested a few vendor-specific properties like
              -webkit-text-size-adjust and other tweaks to improve
              compatibility, which I added in. Then, I used MailChimp to inline
              all the CSS properly, since some email clients remove head and
              style tags.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              To test the final result, I used PutsMail by Litmus to email it to
              myself. It looked just like the prototype, but it wasn’t
              responsive. I used media queries, but I was stumped as to why it
              didn’t work. After some digging, I found out that Gmail (and a few
              others) doesn’t support media queries. So, I had to rethink my
              approach. Instead of relying on media queries, I changed the table
              cells to display as block elements with 100% width. That way, the
              content stacked naturally on smaller screens — no media queries
              needed.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              After confirming everything worked properly in both desktop and
              mobile formats, I delivered the final HTML file to the team, and
              mock-ups of the final email.

              This project pushed me to work outside of my usual front-end
              comfort zone and adapt to the strict limitations of HTML emails. I
              learned how important it is to plan out the table structure early,
              and how even small styling choices can affect compatibility across
              email clients. If I did it again, I’d spend more time upfront
              prepping the layout and researching how to make it responsive
              without relying on media queries.
